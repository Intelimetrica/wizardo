### The language agnostic code generator tool


## What is Wizardo?

Wizardo is a tool that allows you to create code generators to bootstrap new projects or new features in existing ones.

With Wizardo generators, you can also modify existing files to insert snippets of code whenever is needed.

It uses templates to generate new files and a configuration file to execute all the steps required to run a scaffold. Its variables based CLI adds dynamism to generators.

Go to [guides](https://intelimetrica.github.io/wizardo/guides) to start building your first Wizardo Generator.
